# CAPTAIN: A Testbed for Co-Simulation of Scalable Serverless Computing Environments for AIoT Enabled Predictive Maintenance in Industry 4.0

The massive amounts of data generated by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) require considerable pro cessing power, which increases carbon emissions and energy usage, and we need sustainable solutions to enable flexible manufacturing. Serverless computing shows potential for meeting this requirement by scaling idle containers to zero energy efficiency and cost, but this will lead to a cold start delay. Most solutions rely on idle containers, which necessitates dynamic request time forecasting and container execution monitoring. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) can provide autonomous and sustainable solutions by combining IIoT with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve this problem. Therefore, we develop a new testbed, CAPTAIN, to facilitate AI-based co simulation of scalable and flexible serverless computing in IIoT environments. The AI module in the CAPTAIN framework employs Random Forest (RF) and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to optimize cold start frequency and prevent cold starts based on their prediction results. The proxy module additionally monitors the client-server network and constantly updates the AI module training dataset via a message queue. Finally, we evaluated the proxy module’s performance using a predictive maintenance-based real-world IIoT application and the AI module’s performance in a realistic serverless environment using a Microsoft Azure dataset. The AI module of the CAPTAIN outperforms baselines in terms of cold start frequency, computational time with 0.5 milliseconds, energy consumption with 1161.0 joules, and CO2 emissions with 32.25e 05 gCO2. The CAPTAIN testbed provides a co-simulation of sustainable and scalable serverless computing environments for AIoT-enabled predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0.

CAPTAIN framework consists of two main modules, AI and Proxy, and is positioned between the client and the server. The proxy module records transaction information (date, latency, etc.) by monitoring all traffic between the client and the server. Then, the AI ​​Module in the CAPTAIN Framework is trained using this information. The main task of the AI ​​module is to predict possible cold start times by making time-series predictions and to make the containers operational by sending PING to the server. Thus, it is aimed to reduce the frequency of cold starts. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the Main Diagram and Architecture for the CAPTAIN framework. For more details, please see the paper.


## Datasets

In this paper, two different cold start datasets were used in the experiments on cold start prediction and prevention. For this reason, two different Jupyter Notebook files were created for the two datasets. The first dataset is the Predictive Maintenance Dataset, and the second dataset is the Microsoft Azure Dataset. The datasets used in the CAPTAIN framework are given below.
